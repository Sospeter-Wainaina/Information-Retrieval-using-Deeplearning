# Information-Retrieval-using-Deeplearning
Searching for the information we need from a corpus of text can be very cumbersum for us humans.
Machines on the other hand can do it effortlessly depending on how they understood the data and 
if they do understand the natural language.In the recent years The field of NLP has grown tremendously. We can talk to computers like chatbots. They can handle some basic tasks. A good example, Major Universities are using chatbots to help prospective students to find the program that best suits them. Interesting right?

Back to the main agenda, what if we could bbe able to load the piece of text to a piece of software and ask it questions and the machine learning model should be able to respond with the 
answer that you are looking for and also provide the paragraph from where it got the answer.
Its a working progress .
